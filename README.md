# Node-Express-Handlebars
Deployed app --> [Burgers](https://burger1111.herokuapp.com/)

The purpose of the "Burgers!!" app is to demonstrate the ability of this developer to produce a full-stack web-application served via an Express framework. The app is built according to the Model-View-Controller architecture of application development. 
### What the app does 
Users can provide a burger name, it will be written to a mySQL database indicating that the burger is ready to be eaten. The controller of the app will route requests to: 
 
 - Display which burgers have been eaten and not eaten (GET request)
 - Update the database when a user indicates they've eaten a burger, moving the burger name into the "eaten" column (PUT Request)
 - Add a record to the database when a user submits a new burger name (POST Request)
 ### Technologies 
 ```
* Express 
* SS/HTML/JS on the Front 
* MiddleWare to leverage Favicons, and JSON responses to API requests 
* mySQL database 
 ```
